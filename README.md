# Experimental-study-on-SIFCON
Introduction

This chapter presents the details of experimentation for investigating the
various characteristics of SIFCON at normal and elevated temperature conditions.
From the detailed review of literature, it is concluded that there is need to assess
properties of SIFCON with locally available materials. In this investigation the natural
sand is completely replaced by manufactured sand. The investigated strength
characteristics of SIFCON are compressive strength, Split tensile strength, Flexural
strength, loss of weight of the specimens before and after exposing to elevated
temperature. Stress-strain behavior of SIFCON under compression is also studied.
Each SIFCON mix is prepared using locally available plain steel fibres, with three
percentage fibre volume fractions, i.e. 8 %, 10 % and 12 %.

This chapter is organized as follows. The various materials used in the
experimentation are cement, sand (fine aggregate), mixing water, chemical admixture
and steel fibres. The complete experimental program of the research has been
discussed in sections 3.2 and 3.3. The various tests that were performed to evaluate
the strength properties of SIFCON are discussed in section 3.4. The effect of elevated
temperature on the mechanical properties is discussed in section 3.5 and finally
concluded in section 3.6.

3.2 Materials

The constituent materials of SIFCON used in this investigation are steel fibres,
cement-sand based slurry, high range water reducing admixture to improve the flow
ability of the slurry. The properties of these materials are presented in the following
sections.
